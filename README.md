1. Initialization:
   - Set up the network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer, including the home gateway, motion detector, siren, webcam, and tablet.
   - Configure IP addresses, subnet masks, and routing on the network devices.

2. Motion Detector:
 When motion is detected, trigger an event to activate the siren and start recording video on the webcam.

3. Siren Activation:
   - Upon receiving the motion detection event of a thief or anyone, a signal is sent to the siren device to activate it.
   - This can be achieved through the appropriate network communication, such as sending a command or signal to the siren device's IP address.

4. Webcam Recording:
   - When motion is detected, it should initiate the recording process on the webcam device.
   - This can involve capturing video frames from the webcam and storing them locally or sending them to a designated storage location.

5. Home Gateway:
   - The home gateway provides internet access to the connected devices, including the tablet.
   - The home gateway should be properly configured to allow communication between the motion detector, siren, webcam, and tablet.
   - Configure any necessary port forwarding or firewall rules to enable communication with external devices or remote monitoring.

6. Tablet Monitoring:

   - The tablet acts as a monitoring device for the security system.
   - Tablet establishes a connection with the home gateway and receives notifications or video streams from the motion detector and webcam.
   - Real-time alerts or notifications can be displayed on the tablet's screen when motion is detected or provide access to recorded videos for review.

Motion Detector is used for detecting any sort of motion. Home Gateway is providing network access to motion detectors, sirens, webcams, and tablets. The siren is turned on when the motion detector detects any kind of motion while the webcam will start recording the video. This type of IoT Smart Device is especially used in banks where there is a risk of robbery. These systems keep track of and continuously monitor any activity, through tablets, it’s monitored, we can also generate notifications through API for timely and immediate response. 
 

All the devices (Motion detector, siren, webcam, and tablet) are connected to the IoT server that’s Home Gateway. Home Gateway is used for providing network access to all these devices.
CCTV and Siren are also connected to the home gateway IoT server

Device Conditions: 
The siren & webcam will be turned on when the motion detector detects any motion and will be turned off automatically when there is no motion.

When we click on the motion detector, it senses motion and is turned on. The siren is also turned on and automatically the webcam starts recording the video as well as shown in the figure. All this can be monitored and seen on the tablet connected to the devices.
